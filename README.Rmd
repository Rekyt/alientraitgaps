# alientraitgaps: Globlal Trait gaps in Alien Plants

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Goal

This repository contains a full workflow to assess to what extent alien plants
have gaps in their traits. At global scale we know very little about alien
plants. Especially trait-based ecology can help us understand,
among other things, the invasion successes of alien plants. To use this approach
we first need to know which traits are available for alien plants.

The goal of this project is to look into functional trait databases and quantify
the number and type of traits available for alien plants globally.
This is done comparing different global scale trait databases (TRY and BIEN).

From this extensive analysis of data gaps, a list of priority species for which
trait data is needed, is going to be generated to see where to focus the trait
gathering efforts.


## Installation

The repository contain the full workflow to reproduce our analyses, including
our figures.

You can install it from GitHub using:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Rekyt/alientraitgaps")
```


## How to run

The workflow leverages the `targets` package to get reproducible analyses.
To run the workflow, copy the repository then run `targets::tar_make()`.
**/!\ WARNING: this can take a while to run depending on your computer**.
It also needs access to the GloNAF database.
